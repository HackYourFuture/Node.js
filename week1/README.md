## Videos

Your mentor Andrej has made some videos for this week's material that complements the reading material. You can find them here: [Videos 1 - 6](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVYDhqbgYpYXpc_l_Vlj8yz3LjgkkWXnn) (up to and including the Express example)

## Week goals

This week we are going to have our first meeting with the backend and learn how to make API's like the ones you used during your final project in the Using API's module.

Let's first take a broad look at what the term backend really means by reading up on it [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/software-development/backend.md). A common used term when looking at the frontend/backend ecosystem is the client-server model, read up about that [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/definitions/client-server-model.md). It would also be good to dive a little deeper into the communication protocol that is used in the internet by looking into the [http protocol](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/the-internet/http.md) and the [http methods](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/the-internet/http-methods) that are used to communicate certain actions.

Now that we have gotten the big picture, it is time to see how we can build these things. To be able to use JavaScript on the backend, Node.js was created. Have a good look at what Node.js is [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/node-js/).

In the Node.js page you have read about different modules (or packages as some call them) and we will be using one of these called **Express.js** with which we can easily create web servers. The express.js package has become an industry standard that is widely used. Have a look what it does [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/node-js/express-js).

Lastly, testing your API's without a frontend is a little cumbersome. Have a look at the tool Postman that is used a lot to test out API's [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/tools/postman.md)

## Extra reading

If you have time left over this week (or any week this module), then it is a good idea to look at the topic of 'the internet' and learn how it works [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/the-internet/). This will be valuable when you get into the more complex applications and may also help your understanding of the big picture.
