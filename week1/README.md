# Week 1 outline

"What it really means is that Node.js is not a silver-bullet new platform that will dominate the web development world. Instead, it’s a platform that fills a particular need."

This week's homework

## Assignment:
Create a http server that can add and subtract from a number, which we will call the "state". Please see in `index.js` in this folder as starting material. Pay extra attention to line 21, which contains some hints for this week `console.log('New http request received', request.url);`

Rule 1: DO NOT USE EXPRESS.JS
Rule 2: you can use other packages, but you HAVE to also make a version WITHOUT any NPM packages (http, of course, is not NPM but a node native package)
```
// The state
var state = 10; 
```

Endpoints criteria
```
// /state 
// response: the current state in a html format 
// when the server starts, this should return "10"
http://localhost:8080/state 

// /add
// Response: "ok" in html format
// This should add 1 to the current state
http://localhost:8080/add

// /remove
// Response: "ok" in html format
// This should subtract 1 ƒrom the current state
http://localhost:8080/remove

// /reset
// Response: "ok" in html format
// This should set the state back to 10
http://localhost:8080/reset

// Any other URL
// Response: return error code 404: Not found with a friendly message
// and do not change the state variable
http://localhost:8080/subtract
```
