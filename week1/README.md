## What is Node.js?

From Node.js' [website]()https://nodejs.org/en/:

> Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
> Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight
> and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of
> open source libraries in the world.
