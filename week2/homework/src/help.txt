  
  Hello there! 

  Did you type 'node index.js' or 'node index.js help' 
  to see the help section?

  Since you are already here.. 

  Type node index.js and then type..

  list -> Shows current to-dos(Shows nothing if the list is empty)
          Example: node index.js list

  add  -> Adds to-do tasks to the list. 
          Use quotes around the task you want to add.
          Example: node index.js add "Buy milk"

remove -> Removes to-do tasks from the list. 
          Use quotes around the task and be very specific of what you 
          want to remove since it is case sensitive.
          Example: node index.js remove "Buy milk"

 reset -> Resets the list of to-dos.
          Example: node index.js reset
