# Node.js Week 2 (Homework)

## Learning goals

## 1. Extending the todo application

During class we built a simple todo application. It turns out that the application got really popular and now several people are using it.
You would think that is great news, but because we never thought about multiple people now we have no idea which todos are for which person.
The application is a mess.

It is your job to fix it. Here are the requirements:

1. The app needs to be able to manage **users**. User have a name (and an id generated by the system). Users can be 
  1.1 created
  1.2 read
  1.3 updated, and
  1.4 deleted. 

2. Tasks will no longer be created directly, but can **only** be created for a specific user. Similarly all other task operations (read, update and delete) need to be for a specific user. The read operation will only return the tasks for a specific user. When a user is deleted all his todos also need to be deleted.

Use postman to test your solution.

### 1.2. Bonus

With the latest changes the app has become very large. It is hard to find specific function in the large js file. Split up the application code into at least two files.
