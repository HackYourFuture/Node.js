## Week goals

This week we are going to learn some more terms that come up when discussing API's. Let's first start with the term CRUD, read about what this is [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/definitions/crud).

You might have noticed that the four CRUD actions nicely align with the HTTP methods from last week:

1. Create -> POST
2. Read -> GET
3. Update -> PUT
4. Delete -> DELETE

Having covered these terms, we can now look into one of the most common API architectures, the REST API. Have a look at the explanation of this design [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/the-internet/designing-apis.md).

We will also look into enhancing your API. One thing to keep in mind that your own API can make use of other API's for certain functionality! In fact, this happens all the time and is a great way to split the separation of concerns. Have a look at how this works [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/node-js/consuming-apis.md).

## Career Training II: interview preparation

It is time to start practicing interviews as it is a crucial part of the hiring process. The [interview preparation repository](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/interviewpreparation) goes over the different types of interviews you will go through with companies as well as the ones that you will have to endure during the curriculum.

### Career Training II: planning

You don't have to do all of this immediately. This week you will receive a message from Giuseppina in your cohort channel to schedule the Career Training II session. _Before_ that session, make sure to have:

- Read the whole [‘Interview Preparation’ Repo](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/interviewpreparation).
- Done the assignments: make a copy of [this file](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/114rTGS4eG6tpkrMAyVIdvgTrnpmkRL6ax_smkw1B0HI/copy) and submit your answers to the team [here](https://hackyourfuture.typeform.com/to/s6zYAugm).
