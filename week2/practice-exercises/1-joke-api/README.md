# Chuck Norris programs do not accept input

Did you know that there is an API for Chuck Norris jokes? That's incredible, right!?

Write a small JavaScript function that calls this API [The Internet Chuck Norris Databases](http://www.icndb.com/api/) and returns a random joke. You'll be using the `node` command to execute the JavaScript file. To `GET` a random joke inside the function, use the API: https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random (see `node-fetch`). Make use of `async/await` and `try/catch`.

Hints:

- To install node dependencies you should first initialize npm
- Print the entire response to the console to see how it is structured.
