### Assignment for this weak:
Create Node JS server that

- Listens on port 8080

- Allows users to list todos, get a todo, delete a todo, delet all todos, and update a todo.

Some other notes:
- All responses should be in JSON.
- Follow the REST design principles: Use the proper method, response status codes, and consistent URL paths.
- Try to apply the MVC model to your file structure. It will save you time in following assignments!
- Test your API using Postman.
- There is a commented out example to start with in my `index.js`
