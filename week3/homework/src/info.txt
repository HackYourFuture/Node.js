How it works?
To add a TODO         : POST todos/ (request body should include a JSON as {"text":"TODO"})
To see all TODOS      : GET todos/
To update a TODO      : POST todos/id:  (request body should include a JSON as {"text":"TODO"})
To delete a TODO      : DELETE todos/id:
To delete all  TODOS  : DELETE/todos
To set todo as done   : POST /todos/id:/done
To set TODO as undone : DELETE /todos/id:/done
