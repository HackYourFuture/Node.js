# Node.js Week 3 (Homework)

## Learning goals

## 1. Build a web server that uses an external API

In this first assignment the goal is to build something similar to what was build during class. 

First of all choose an API that you like from [here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) (apis that only serve images such as RandomCat are not allowed).
Build a node server that calls this API. The node server should be serving at least a basic html file using pug.

Be creative.
