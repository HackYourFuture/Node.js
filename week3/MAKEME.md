# Assignments Node.js Week 3

## Todo List

1. Prep exercises
2. Practice exercises
3. Optional: Side project ideas

## **1. Prep exercises**

> Prep exercises are exercises that you should work on _before_ the session on Sunday. These are a little more difficult or show an important concept and as such are a great exercise to talk about with your mentor. Have a solution ready by Sunday as you may be asked to show what you did.

Inside your `Node.js` fork, go to the folder `week3`. Inside of that folder, navigate to `/prep-exercises`. For each exercise, you will find a separate folder. The `README` explains what needs to be done. There will also be some questions at the bottom to think about. Go through them _before_ the session on Sunday as it will be covered then.

## **2. Practice exercises**

Inside of your `Node.js` fork, go to the folder `week3`. Inside of that folder, navigate to `/practice-exercises`. For each exercise, you will find a separate folder. The `README` explains what needs to be done. Go through them to practice concepts that you have learned about!


## **3. Optional: Side project ideas**

> A part of the HackYourFuture curriculum is to work on as many side projects as you can throughout the time you have. This is a nice way to add extra knowledge to your arsenal and show in your CV that you are motivated to learn new technologies. There are plenty of people available to help you out in the `#get-help` channel on Slack so definitely make use of that! Have a look at the [hyf_projects repo](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/hyf_projects/blob/main/README.md#project-2-a-try-out-application) for more details.

### 3.1 Document your API!

When using API's in the `Using API's` module you will have noticed that those API's all have extensive documentation on how to use it. As developers like to build tools for everything there are quite a few good tools to semi-automatically document your API from your code! Saves a lot of work and makes sure that you don't forget to update the documentation if the code changes!

Add automatic documentation to your API by using one of these tools (Swagger, apiDoc or docbox)!

### 3.2 Web Sockets

It is becoming normal that all webpages automatically refresh whenever there is new data available. Think about the live news feeds that tell you when there is a new item, or that there is a new message on twitter. This is all implemented using Web Sockets, where you as a programmer can set up a link between your page and the server.

Have a go by building a simple full stack chat application with an express websocket server!

### 3.3 GraphQL

We focused solely on the REST way of building an API, but there is a different way called `GraphQL`. This allows the frontend to define in their query the data that they want to get back. Very cool, but also quite complex. If you are up for a challenge, try to recreate your project using GraphQL (`express-graphql` package is probably the easiest way)!

## **SUBMIT YOUR HOMEWORK!**

After you've finished your todo list it's time to show us what you got! Upload all your files to your forked repository (same as week 1). Then make a pull request to it.

If you need a refresher, take a look at the following [guide](../hand-in-assignments-guide.md) to see how it's done.

The assignments that needs to be submitted is the following:
