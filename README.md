# HackYourFuture - Node.js

This 3-week HYF Module is about Node.js. We can think of Node.js as "Javascript
not running in a browser". This is what we mean by "backend", as in "backend
developer".

## Planning

| Week | Topic              | Read                              | Homework                                    |
| ---: | ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
|   1. | Node.js, npm, http | [Week 1 Reading](week1/README.md) | [Week 1 Homework](week1/homework/README.md) |
|   2. | fs, process        | [Week 2 Reading](week2/README.md) | [Week 2 Homework](week2/homework/README.md) |
|   3. | express, REST      | [Week 3 Reading](week3/README.md) | [Week 3 Homework](week3/homework/README.md) |

## Watch before your first Node.js session

Watch Jason's playlist on [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/SharedPlaylist/a850f6b7bddf437f8b98679f5f9d9cc3) (45 min)

And you can start with the [Node.js Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gcy9lrvMJ75z9maRw4byYp)

## Promises' refresher

Read Jim's [summary of promises](https://github.com/remarcmij/JavaScript/blob/master/fundamentals/promises.md)
from JavaScript module and [Promises, async/await](http://javascript.info/async).

## Node.js Setup

We're going to use the latest Node.js LTS 8.x. Follow one of the following
instructions depending on your operating system:

* [CentOS/Fedora/RHEL](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#rpminstall)
* [Debian/Ubuntu](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall)
* [macOS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Pre-requisites

We will build on knowledge from the following HYF (sub)modules. If we feel we
have gaps we should review the curriculum ourselves or ask a teacher to help.

- [JavaScript](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/JavaScript)
- [Git](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Git)
- [Bash/Command Line Interface](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/CommandLine)

## What will we learn?

- What is Node.js?
- Using Node Package Manager (NPM)
- Using `require` to include modules
- Using `http` to handle and respond to HTTP requests
- Using `fs` to read from and write to files
- Using `process` to read arguments from command line
- Using `express` to make a RESTful API

## Why Node.js?

It is essential to have a backend for almost all web application. The backend is
a place where we, developers, can store our data, communicate with users and let
users communicate with us, do smart things like calculations, data processing,
etc.

There are many languages for this. You might've heard of Java, C, C++, C#, Go,
Python, Ruby, PHP and [so on](https://blog.newrelic.com/2016/08/18/popular-programming-languages-2016-go/).

There are two reasons why we at HYF chose Node.js over others:

1. You already know JavaScript, so it's easier to get started;
2. Node.js is great for making web APIs because it is asynchronous by nature and
   thus allows for high throughput, so it allows many users to make very light
   requests at the same time.

## Handing in homework

Take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0yomUVVpU)
made by Daan, he explains how your homework needs to be handed in from now on.

Also review the [Git workflow material](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Git/blob/master/Lecture-3.md)
and use it as a reference.
